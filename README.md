## Overview

`crankshaft` is a headless task execution framework written in Rust: it's being
developed in coordination with the [`sprocket`] project with the goal of enabling
large-scale bioinformatics analyses. There is no associated `crankshaft` command line
tool‚Äîthe end user is really engine _developers_ who want to include it as a core task
execution library in their own command line tools.

## Guiding Principles

- `crankshaft` aims to be a **high-performance** task execution framework
  capable of concurrently managing and executing upwards of 20,000 concurrent
  tasks. The core focus is enabling middle- to large-scale bioinformatics
  analyses, though it can also be used to design smaller scale execution
  engines.
- `crankshaft` is **headless**, which means that it doesn't do anything on its
  own; in fact, it _must_ be driven by some external orchestration code. This
  allows the `crankshaft` library itself to focus on performance improvements
  that can be enjoyed across the entire community.
- `crankshaft` is developed **independently of any particular workflow
  language**. Though it's part of the Sprocket project, it's not based on WDL,
  and, in theory, multiple frontends based on different workflow
  languages can exist (and we hope this is the case)!

## üìö Getting Started

### Installation

To use `crankshaft`, you'll need to install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).
We recommend using [rustup](https://rustup.rs/) to accomplish this. Once Rust is
installed, you can create a new project and add the latest version of
`crankshaft` using the following command.

```bash
cargo add crankshaft
```

Once you've added `crankshaft` to your dependencies, you should head over to the
[`examples`] to see how you can use the library in your projects.

## üñ•Ô∏è Development

### Prerequisites

A protobuf compiler is required to build Crankshaft. Please follow the [installation guide](https://protobuf.dev/installation/) to install the compiler.

### Building

To bootstrap a development environment, please use the following commands.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone git@github.com:stjude-rust-labs/crankshaft.git
cd crankshaft

# Build the crate in release mode
cargo build --release
```

## üößÔ∏è Tests

Before submitting any pull requests, please make sure the code passes the
following checks (from the root directory).

```bash
# Run the project's tests.
cargo test --all-features

# Ensure the project doesn't have any linting warnings.
cargo clippy --all-features

# Ensure the project passes `cargo fmt`.
cargo fmt --check

# Ensure the docs build.
cargo doc
```
